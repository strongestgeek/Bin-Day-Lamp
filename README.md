# Bin-Day-Lamp
A custom lamp/light to show what bins go out depending on the colour it is shining. 
<h2>
  We plan to make two* different versions.
</h2>
<b>One version will be for the Pi Pico and then another version will be for other Raspberry Pi's with operating systems to run the script in the background along with any other systems you might have on that Pi.</b>
<li>Raspberry Pi 4B & 5</li>
<li>Raspberry Pi Zero W 2</li>
<li>Raspberry Pico W</li>

<b>Might look into Arduino and other microcontrollers to see the most basic and cheapest way we can achieve this.</b>
